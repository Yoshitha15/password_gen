# Password_Generator
This password generator is a simple front-end application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to create secure, random passwords based on user-defined length. The user can specify the desired password length (between 6 and 32 characters) through an input field, and upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the app dynamically generates a password consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password is then displayed on the screen for easy access. This project is ideal for learning basic front-end development concepts and can be expanded with additional features like character exclusions or clipboard functionality.
